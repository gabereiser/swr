  Movement (Directions)
  -----------------------------------------
  Directions in SWR are somewhat ambiguous. For the most part you can
  expect directions like &Geast&w and &Gsouth&w but also directions
  like &Gin&w and &Gout&w.  Sometimes, in the case of boarding a ship,
  the direction or entrance isn't known.

  Movement (Mv)
  -----------------------------------------
  Movement itself is a cost. When you go &Gwest&w into that shop or
  &Gdown&w into that cargo hold, you'll use up what's called an &YMv&w
  point. &YMv&w points automatically generate every server tick and
  you can replenish them with &Gfood&w, &Gdrink&w, or &Cdrugs&w.

  Movement (Doors)
  -----------------------------------------
  Some exits are closed. These doors can be locked (an item opens them),
  security gates (only a certain faction can pass), sealed doors (only a
  scripted event opens them), or keypad doors (you must know the keycode).

  Movement (Space)
