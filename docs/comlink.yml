  &wSWR has a unique radio system. Unlike other muds that have channels, we
  have a space radio! Frequencies can be tuned using the &ytune&w command.

  Our radios support frequencies in the ranges of 100.000mhz to 500.000mhz
  in 250khz increments. (100.000mhz, 100.250mhz, 100.500mhz...)

  Your comlink has a bar on it that shows where in the frequency bands your
  comlink is tuned to. It looks like this...

  &G----[&W█&x*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*&G]----&w

  This is 100.000mhz, the bottom of the band.

  &G----[&x*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*'*.*&W█&G]----&w

  This is 500.000mhz, the top of the band.

  Common bands form channels. Here's our list of common channels:

  - Newbie        (100.000mhz)
  - General OOC   (200.000mhz)
  - GM/Admin Help (500.000mhz)
  - Imperial News (300.000mhz)
  - Rebel Radio   (250.000mhz)
  - Trade Network (400.000mhz)
