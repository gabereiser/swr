  Building worlds and creating iconic locations is no easy task. Players
  of SWR are already well versed in the locations around the galaxy. To
  make a compelling world, you'll have to be creative and have some
  scripting skills. That said, it's incredibly easy to build worlds in
  SWR. Here's a list of some helpful commands:

  acreate - Creates a new area.
  asave   - Saves an area (and all it's rooms). Use this frequently.
  areset  - Resets an area (or all areas).

  dig     - Creates a room or repurposes a prototype room. This allows one
            to build out areas really quickly.
  rset    - To set fields on a room. Name, Description, etc.
  rexit   - To create an exit between rooms.
  rremove - Removes a room from the game. Make sure you aren't inside.
  rstat   - Displays room information, flags, etc.

  ocreate - Creates a new area object.
  oset    - Sets a field on an object. Name, Description, etc.
  ospawn  - Creates a spawn (an area reset) for an object.
  ostat   - Displays the object stats.
  oremove - Removes an object from the game (entirely, but the file still exists for next boot).
  
  mcreate - Creates a new area Mobile.
  mset    - Sets a field on an object.
  mspawn  - Creates a spawn (an area reset) for a mobile.
  mstat   - Displays the object stats.
  mremove - Removes a mobile from the game (entirely, AND DELETES THE MOBILE.YML!!!!)

  screate - Creates a new ship prototype.
  sset    - Sets a field on a ship prototype.
  sspawn  - Spawns a ship from a prototype (can only be used in spaceports).
  sstat   - Displays the ship stats.
  sremove - Removes a ship prototype from the game (entirely, AND ANY SHIPS DERIVED FROM IT!!!)
