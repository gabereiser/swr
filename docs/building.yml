  Building worlds and creating iconic locations is no easy task. Players
  of SWR are already well versed in the locations around the galaxy. To
  make a compelling world, you'll have to be creative and have some
  scripting skills. That said, it's incredibly easy to build worlds in
  SWR. Here's a list of some helpful commands:

  acreate - Creates a new area.
  asave   - Saves an area (and all it's rooms). Use this frequently.

  dig     - Creates a room or repurposes a prototype room. This allows one
            to build out areas really quickly.
  rset    - To set fields on a room. Name, Description, etc.
  rexit   - To create an exit between rooms.
  rremove - Removes a room from the game. Make sure you aren't inside.
  rstat   - Displays room information, flags, etc.
