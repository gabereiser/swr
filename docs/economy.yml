  Money / Credits
  ------------------------------------------------
  Income in SWR is important. How else will you afford that new speeder or purchase your
  first spaceship. Earning income depends on your profession and play style. Here are a
  few ways you can earn a living in the Star Wars universe.

  &GCombat&w         - Some mobs drop loot. Some loot is rare and worth a lot of credits to shops.
  &GTrade&w          - Buy low and sell high. Not all shops in the galaxy have the same prices for goods.
  &GEngineering&w    - People need things so you make them and sell them.
  &GTechnician&w     - Ships need parts and repair. You can make ship modules, repair ships, sell blueprints.
  &GSalvage&w        - Space battles leave salvage on the surface of nearby planets. Some could be lucrative.
  &GBegging&w        - Some citizens take pity on the poor.
  &GJoin a Faction&w - Factions pay salaries based on rank.
  &GJoin a Clan&w    - Some clans give out rewards.

  No matter what your play style is, you'll find ways to earn a living. Certain skills like &Ymarket analysis&w can
  increase payouts when trading. Skills like &Ynegotiating&w can help increase profits for goods sold to
  vendors and shops. Skills like &Yreverse-engineering&w can help with salvage. The choice is yours.
