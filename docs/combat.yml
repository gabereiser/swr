  Combat is a vital part of life here in SWR. Whether it's defending Yavin from imperial
  forces or fighting rebels on Bespin. There's a reason to fight everywhere. In SWR,
  fighting takes several forms.

  &GGround&w
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  &GMartial-Arts&w  - Hand to hand combat, without weapons. The default. It's hard to master
                  but mastering it will make you more powerful than you can possibly
                  imagine &y(STR/DEX primary stat)&w
  &GVibro-Blades&w  - When you need a little extra stabbing action. &y(DEX primary stat)&w

  &GForce-Pikes&w   - Larger than a vibro-blade, these weapons are heavy hitters for the up
                  close and personal. &y(STR primary stat)&w
  &GBlasters&w      - Small arms, pistols, the sidearm of choice throughout the galaxy &y(DEX
                  primary stat)&w
  &GRifles&w        - Larger rifles, more firepower, heavier hitting and to carry. Unable to
                  hide and smuggle through checkpoints. &y(STR primary stat)&w
  &GRepeaters&w     - Even larger guns that require a huge amount of strength to carry. Best
                  if mounted. Small turrets are considered repeaters. &y(STR primary stat)&w
  &GBowcasters&w    - Bowcasters/Sniper rifles, the finesse guns. Slower to fire but longer range.
                  &y(DEX primary stat)&w
  &GGrenades&w      - Throwables, thermal detonators, and pipebombs - oh my. &y(STR primary stat)&w

  &GMines&w         - Plant in the ground and will detonate when stepped on. &y(STR primary stat)&w

  &GClaymore&w      - Like a mine, but only kills the person who triggers it. &y(DEX primary stat)&w
  
  &GLightsaber&w    - A laser sword used only by the &cForce Sensitive&w. &y(DEX primary stat)&w
