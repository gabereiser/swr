  &wSWR features several modes of communicating. The most common (and most used) is the &Gsay&w
  command. Other forms are &Gcom&w, &Gooc&w, and &Gclansay&w. Below is a list of communication
  commands and their function. Several shortcuts are added to make communication easier.

  &Gsay&w       - Says something to the current room (' shortcut) [example: 'Hello. / say Hello.]
  &Gshout&w     - Says something to the current room and adjacent rooms. [example: shout I need help!]
  &Gyell&w      - Same as shout
  &Gclansay&w   - Says something to your clan/guild. (: shortcut) [example: :Where are we meeting? / clansay Where are we meeting?]
  &Gcomsay&w    - Says something to your tuned frequency. (" shortcut) [example: "What planet are you on? / comsay What planet are you on?]
    &W-&Gtune&w   - Tunes your comlink to a frequency. Only other players on the same frequency will hear your &Gcomsay&w.
  &Gshipsay&w   - Says something over your ship's intercom to all rooms on your ship. (; shortcut) [example: ;We have arrived. / shipsay We have arrived.]

  &Gemote&w     - Emotes a message to the room you are in. (. shortcut) [example: .sits down / emote sits down]  *Character sits down*

  Communication is vital to the game. It allows you to roleplay your character, talk to NPC's, talk to other characters, and
  get quests. It progresses the story line, gives information, and is the backbone of the game. Be social. This game requires
  &Yteamwork.&d
