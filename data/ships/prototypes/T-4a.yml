desc: |
    The Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, also known as the Lambda-class shuttle,
    Imperial Lambda, Imperial Transport or the Imperial Shuttle, was a
    multi-purpose transport with a trihedral foil design used by the
    Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War, and was considered an
    elegant departure from the standards of brutish Imperial engineering.

    The shuttles were often used by high-ranking Imperial officers and such
    dignitaries as Darth Vader and Emperor Sheev Palpatine, but were more
    commonly found ferrying stormtroopers or cargo.

            You are in the cockpit room of the T-4a. There are two pilot seats
            and two jump seats. Most of the flight controls are on the main
            console in front of you. However a few switches for control of
            auxillary systems are on the side panel. Overall, it's a clean
            looking cockpit of Imperial engineering.

        desc: |
            You are on the ramp of the T-4a. It's a small crowded space when
            the rear ramp is closed. When it's open it's an easy stroll down
            to the surface. Various suits for toxic environments line the
            west wall. On the east is a rack of equipment used for the
            engines which are accessible from a hatch on either side of the
            room.
