    X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive
    S-foils that resembled the High Galactic script's character "X" in attack
    formation. They were heavily armed with four laser cannons on the S-foils
    and proton torpedo launchers in the fuselage. X-wings were designed for
    dogfighting and long missions. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel
    Alliance used X-wing models like the T-65B X-wing starfighter and T-65C-A2
    X-wing in many battles, deploying X-wings in engagements such as the
    Attack on Lothal, the Battle of Yavin, the Battle of Endor, and the Battle
    of Jakku.
