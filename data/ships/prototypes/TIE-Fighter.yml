    The TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, also known as the TIE/LN
    starfighter and commonly called the TIE fighter, was the signature
    starfighter of the Galactic Empire and de facto symbol of Imperial space
    superiority. Its official production name was the Twin Ion Engine "line
    edition" space superiority starfighter. Instantly recognizable from
    the roar of its engines as well as its unique design, the TIE/ln exuded
    Imperial power and prestige across the galaxy, seeing use throughout the
    Empire's political existence.
