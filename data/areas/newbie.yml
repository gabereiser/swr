        You are standing in an imperial jail cell with no recollection
        of how you got there. A simple white plastasteel room with a
        durasteel door is all you can see. You see a guard run by a small
        door window. Just then, the door clicks.

      desc: |
        You are standing outside of a jail cell in an imperial jail. Jail cells line the walls.
        Alarms are going off around you. The room keeps flashing }Rred&d&W and }Wwhite&d&W. To the
        &Gnorth&W you can see a turbolift.

      desc: |
        You are standing inside a turbo lift. It's a pretty basic imperial lift suited for
        transporting only a few people at a time. Clearly intended to keep morale low. On
        the wall you can see a plate with floors listed.
