      You are standing in an imperial jail cell with no recollection
      of how you got there. A simple white plastasteel room with a
      durasteel door is all you can see. You see a guard run by a small
      door window. Just then, the door clicks.

    name: Outside a jail cell
    desc: |
      You are standing outside of a jail cell in an imperial jail.
      Alarms are going off around you. The room keeps flashing 
      }Rred&d and }Wwhite&d. You feel a slight thud
      coming from outside the ship.
