    name: A jail cell
    desc: |
      You are standing in an imperial jail cell with no recollection
      of how you got there. A simple white plastasteel room with a
      durasteel door is all you can see. You see a guard run by a small
      door window. Just then, the door clicks.

    name: Outside a jail cell
    desc: |
      You are standing outside of a jail cell in an imperial jail. Jail cells line the walls.
      Alarms are going off around you. The room keeps flashing }Rred&d&W and }Wwhite&d&W. To the
      &Gnorth&W you can see a turbolift.

    name: A turbolift
    desc: |
      You are standing inside a turbo lift. It's a pretty basic imperial lift suited for
      transporting only a few people at a time. Clearly intended to keep morale low. On
      the wall you can see a plate with floors listed.
